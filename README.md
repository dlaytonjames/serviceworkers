# Service Workers Example

This is a very simple working example of service workers using VueJS powered interface.

You will need to use a web server as the file:// protocol will not work with Service Workers. You must use https or http://localhost in order for the Service Worker to work.

Once loaded once the site should be available with no access to the web server
